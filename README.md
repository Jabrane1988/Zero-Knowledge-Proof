# Zero-Knowledge-Proof
In this python we try to identify how should we generate the different zkp parameters in order that it can be functional, note that in this case we use the Chaumâ€“Pedersen Protocol:
p, q are prime numbers and prime between them
g, h are integers with order p
x is the secret number that prover should keep it as secret
y1 and y2 are the initial parameters that verfier and challenger should have both
k is a random number generated by the prover
r1 and r2 are generated by the prover
c is a random number generated by the verifier
s is computed by the prover
Then the zkp works if we verify mathematical conditions
